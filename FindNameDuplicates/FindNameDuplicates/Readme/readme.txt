Find Name Duplicates

This program scans the database for possible name duplicates, e.g. when only the birth year is different or when
only the parsing is different (<Helena [Bonham Carter] vs. <Helena> {Bonham} [Carter]).

I added a checkbox that will enable/disable the comparing of "credited as" with actual names. If this is disabled,
the program will only find results that differ in parsing and or the birth year.

Additionally I created a check on startup, if a new version is available.
